# I'm Upping My P(doom) — music video

A generative, code-rendered music video with word-synced karaoke typography. Every frame is a deterministic function of song time, so the live preview in the browser and the offline 1080p60 (or 4K60) export are identical.

**Watch it in 4K on YouTube:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EoO5413dBY

The YouTube upload is an earlier render: it averages only 4 sub-frames per frame for motion blur, so fast motion shows stepped copies, and YouTube's compression smears the film grain. For the best version, render it locally (see [Render the video](#render-the-video)): the current code picks up to 324 sub-frames per frame where the motion needs them.

The video was made with Claude (Opus 5.5) in Claude Code: the concept and treatment, the lyric alignment and audio analysis, the renderer, every scene and the renders were all worked out in conversation with Claude.

The song is not ours: see [Credits](#credits) for who wrote and made it.

The concept, style bible and plate-by-plate treatment are in [`docs/TREATMENT.md`](docs/TREATMENT.md). The engine and scene API are documented in [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md).

## Layout

- `audio/pdoom.mp3` — the song (the Claude-Pop version, see Credits).
- `lyrics/lyrics.src.js` — the original line-level lyrics (approximate timings).
- `analysis/` — Python (uv) tools that produced the timing data: Demucs stem separation, CTC forced alignment cross-checked with Whisper, beat/downbeat/onset analysis. See `analysis/align.py` and `analysis/analyze.py`.
- `data/lyrics.json` — word-level (and some syllable-level) lyric timings.
- `data/audio.json` — tempo (132.007 BPM), beats, downbeats, sections, drum/vocal onsets and loudness envelopes.
- `app/` — the renderer: TypeScript + three.js, bun + Vite.
  - `src/engine/` — renderer core: timeline playback, post-processing (bloom, halation, grain), typography (Archivo, IBM Plex Mono, Cormorant Garamond, single-stroke plotter fonts), GPU line batches, HUD.
  - `src/scenes/` — one module per plate (`open`, `loss`, `prompt`, `hook`, `room`, `shoggoth`, `spacetime`, `ascent`, `bureau`, `leftturn`, `paperclips`, `fuse`, `stack`, `dense`, `loom`, `ilya`, `outro`) plus shared motifs.
  - `src/timeline.ts` — the edit: scene windows anchored to lyric lines and snapped to the beat grid.
  - `scripts/render.ts` — offline renderer (headless Chrome → raw frames over WebSocket → ffmpeg).
- `out/` — renders (not in the repo).

## Requirements

[bun](https://bun.sh), Google Chrome (the offline renderer drives it headless through playwright-core) and ffmpeg with libx264. The analysis tools need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); the renderer doesn't.

## Preview

```sh
cd app
bun install
bunx vite
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and use the keys below. `?t=23` starts at a given time.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| space | play / pause |
| ← / → | seek ±1 s (±5 s with shift) |
| `,` / `.` | step one frame |
| `[` / `]` | previous / next scene |
| `l` | loop the current scene |
| `h` | hide the UI |

The preview renders in real time on a recent Mac. The export is not real time and is heavier.

## Render the video

```sh
cd app
bun scripts/render.ts video --samples auto --shutter 0.2 --out ../out/pdoom.mp4
```

- **Output:** 1920×1080 at 60 fps, x264 CRF 16, AAC audio.
- **Motion blur:** every frame is the average of many sub-frames spread over a short shutter (`--shutter 0.2`, a fifth of the frame time), so fast motion leaves a continuous streak instead of a few stepped copies. `--samples auto` picks the count per frame: 12 for a still frame, 36 for ordinary camera motion, 108 or 324 for whips, slams and fast zooms. It stops once more sub-frames would no longer change the image by more than `--tol` levels of 255 (default 3). `--samples N` takes a fixed N instead (`--samples 4` makes a quick draft). How it works: "Motion blur and sampling" in [`docs/ENGINE.md`](docs/ENGINE.md).
- **Other modes:** `stills`, `sheet` (contact sheets, `--cuts` for every scene boundary), `perf`, and `plates` (regenerates `public/plates/`, the stills used by the outro's rewind montage; rerun it after changing a scene).

### 4K

```sh
cd app
bun scripts/render.ts video --scale 2 --samples auto --shutter 0.2 --x264 aq-mode=3:rc-lookahead=30 --out ../out/pdoom-4k.mp4
```

- **Output:** a true 3840×2160 render (not an upscale): every layer, line and shader is rendered at the physical resolution. Scenes are laid out in 1920×1080 logical pixels, so the 4K frame looks like the 1080p one, only sharper.
- **Cost:** GPU-bound. A frame takes from about 40 ms (a still frame) to over 10 s (the ray-marched rooms at 108–324 sub-frames). The whole song took about 2.5 hours on an M5 Pro, rendered as segments in two parallel pipelines (`--from`/`--to`, then a lossless concat). Each pipeline uses about 5 GB for headless Chrome plus about 4 GB for ffmpeg; the shorter x264 lookahead above keeps ffmpeg's memory down.
- **Encoding:** the film grain is rendered per 4K pixel, which is expensive to encode: at the default CRF 16 the file runs at about 670 Mbit/s (13 GB for the song, 8× the 1080p file), `--crf 18` gives about 450 Mbit/s and `--crf 20` about 230 Mbit/s.
- `--scale 2` works with every mode. `stills` then saves full-resolution PNGs, and `perf` measures 4K frame times. In the browser preview, add `&scale=2` to the URL.

### Chinese version (中文版)

`--zh` (in the preview, `?zh=1`) renders a localized, bilingual version. The English lyric typography stays as it is, and:

- **Every sung line's Chinese is set inside its plate**, beside or under the English, in the plate's own layer, camera moves, 3D planes and idiom: typed into the prompt field, stamped on the form, lettered on the hanging sign, riding the loss curve and the scope trace, burning along the fuse, engraved with the shoggoth's hatching, slammed with the hook. It is synced to the English vocal: each line is split into segments tied to the English words they translate (`data/lyrics.zh.json`), and a segment lights glyph by glyph while those words are sung, never ahead of the voice. Terms without a short established Chinese name stay in English, and a few lines carry a footnote. The API is `app/src/engine/zh.ts`: a plate claims its lines in `init()` and draws them where its English is (`zhLayer()?.draw(ctx, line, t, x, y, opts)`), or builds its own treatment from the per-glyph karaoke state (`set()`, `glyphState()`, `segLit()`). A line no plate claims falls back to a fixed placement (`render.ts info --zh` lists any).
- **Everything else the plates print is in Chinese** (labels, axes, forms, stamps, map and schedule, UI, footnotes, stickers): display strings go through `tr('English', '中文')` (`app/src/engine/lang.ts`), which returns the English unless `?zh`, so the English render is unchanged. Code, maths, numbers and names stay as they are.
- **Type:** 思源黑体 (Noto Sans SC) stands behind Archivo and IBM Plex Mono, 思源宋体 (Noto Serif SC) behind Cormorant: in the Chinese version `font()` appends the matching Chinese face, so Chinese set in any of the video's families falls back glyph by glyph (outlines too, in `textPathCommands`).
- **Credit:** the engine draws the subtitle credit (中文字幕 + the subtitler's name) top right, on a small flat plate so it stays legible over bright type.
- **The outro's rewind** uses Chinese stills of the plates: `bun scripts/render.ts plates --zh` writes them to `app/public/plates-zh/` (rerun after changing a plate).

```sh
cd app
bun scripts/render-par.ts --workers 7 --chunk 8 --out ../out/pdoom-zh.mp4 --zh --channel msedge --samples auto --max-samples 108 --shutter 0.2
```

- **Parallel export:** `scripts/render-par.ts` renders the song in frame-aligned chunks, each with its own headless browser (`render.ts video --noaudio`), several at once, then concatenates them losslessly and muxes the audio once; an interrupted export resumes from the chunks already done. On Windows (Edge, ANGLE on Direct3D 11) each browser's GPU process is bound by one CPU core while the GPU idles, so exports scale with the number of browsers (about 2.3 GB of RAM each). Pass `--channel msedge` there to drive Edge instead of Chrome.
- **Fonts:** `analysis/make_fonts_zh.py` subsets Noto Sans SC and Noto Serif SC to the characters the Chinese version prints (the translation, and every string literal with Chinese in it under `app/src`); rerun it after changing any Chinese text. `--gb2312` also keeps every GB2312 character (larger files, but new text needs no rerun while you work).
- **Covers:** `bun scripts/render.ts cover --only shoggoth --scale 2` writes a portrait 3:4 and a landscape 4:3 cover (Douyin's two covers) to `out/cover/` (`--sizes 1920x1080` makes Bilibili's 16:9 one): a clean plate of the shoggoth scene (rendered without its type) under the title in `data/lyrics.zh.json` (`cover`). See `app/src/cover.ts`.

## Regenerate the timing data

The committed `data/*.json` files are all the renderer needs. Regenerating them needs the stems and intermediates, which are not in the repo:

- **Stems:** Demucs `htdemucs_ft` into `analysis/stems/htdemucs_ft/pdoom/` (`uv run python -m demucs -n htdemucs_ft -o stems ../audio/pdoom.mp3`), plus the lead vocal from a mel-band-roformer karaoke model (audio-separator) in `analysis/stems/karaoke/lead.wav`.
- **Intermediates:** `ctc_emissions.py`, `whisper_run.py` and `vocal_feats.py` write them to `analysis/work/`. The pipeline is described at the top of `analysis/align.py`.

```sh
cd analysis
uv run python align.py      # data/lyrics.json
uv run python analyze.py    # data/audio.json
```

The models download about 4 GB of weights into `analysis/.cache/`; delete that folder afterwards.
